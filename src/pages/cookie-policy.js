          Necessary/Technical: These Cookies are necessary to allow us to
          operate our Sites so you may access them as you have requested. These
          Cookies, for example, let us recognize that you have created an
          account and have logged into that account to access Site content. They
          also include Cookies that enable us to remember your previous actions
          within the same browsing session and secure our Sites.
          Analytical/Performance: These Cookies are used by us or third-party
          service providers to analyze how the Sites are used and how they are
          performing. For example, these Cookies track what pages are most
          frequently visited, and from what locations our visitors come from. If
          you subscribe to a newsletter or otherwise register with the Sites,
          these Cookies may be correlated to you. These Cookies include, for
          example, Google Analytics cookies. Functionality: These Cookies let us
          operate the Sites in accordance with the choices you make. These

          device. Please note that if you use your browser settings to block all
          Cookies (including strictly necessary Cookies) you may not be able to
          access or use all or parts or functionalities of our Sites. If you
          want to remove previously-stored Cookies, you can manually delete the
          Cookies at any time. However, this will not prevent the Sites from
          placing further Cookies on your device unless and until you adjust
          your Internet browser setting as described above. For more information
